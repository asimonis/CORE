## How to download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need installed on your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

To use this code, start by opening the [Seatech.Rproj](https://github.com/asimonis/Seatech/Seatech.Rproj) file. Note - we use a project-oriented workflow and the [Here](https://here.r-lib.org/) package to set the default directory to the folder where the project is located. This makes it easier for any user to open and run the code.
